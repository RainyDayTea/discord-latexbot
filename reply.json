    "REPLY_WARN" : "Please do not announce to the server when you are going to masturbate. This has been a reoccurring issue and I'm not sure why some people have such underdeveloped social skills that they think that a server full of mostly male strangers would need to know that. No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five, especially considering where that hand has been. I don't want to add this to the rules since it would be embarrassing to new users to see that we have a problem with this. But it is going to be enforced as a rule from now on. If it occurs you will be warned then additional occurrences will be dealt with at the discretion of mod staff, thanks."
